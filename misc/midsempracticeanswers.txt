MID SEMESTER EXAMPLE THAT I WAS STUCK ON:

  Q2A: says error on line 15 because the error sits on line 14 where the semi
  colon is needed however error is on line 15 because the compiler reads lines
  14 and 15 at the same time so line 14 doesn't exist essentially.

  Q2E: Error is actually on line 8, it isn't an integer overflow error, it is
  a simple case of not initialising
    int n = 0;
  on line 8. Therefore unintialized variable
